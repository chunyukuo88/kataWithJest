/**
 You have a list of items where every item has a value and a
 weight. You have a bag that holds a maximum weight of X.

 Write a program that maximizes the value of the items you put
 into the bag while ensuring that you don't exceed the maximum
 weight. For example:

 const items = [
   { id: 'a', value: 10, weight: 3},
   { id: 'b', value: 6, weight: 8},
   { id: 'c', value: 3, weight: 3},
 ];

 const maxWeight = 8;

 const bag = ['a', 'c'] // solution
